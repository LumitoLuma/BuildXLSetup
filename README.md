# BuildXL Installer

## What is BuildXL Installer

In a short way: BuildXL Installer is a WiX-based setup wizard for [BuildXL](https://github.com/microsoft/BuildXL).

And in a long way:

Microsoft Build Accelerator (also known as [BuildXL](https://github.com/microsoft/BuildXL)) is a build engine developed to perform lots of builds at the same time (Microsoft says that you can run 30,000+ builds per day).

This tool is built for big datacenters, since they may need to build hundreds of gigabytes/terabytes of code and this tool makes that process easier and quicker.

The problem is that (originally) you need to compile BuildXL before using it, and you may get some errors while you perform this action. And that is what BuildXL Installer does:

It is a setup wizard that installs a modern version of BuildXL into your computer, adds that folder to PATH (so you can run BuildXL from any place) and replaces the icon of the `.dsc` files with the BuildXL logo.

## Installing BuildXL using BuildXL Installer

All you need is to visit the project website ([gh-pages.lumito.net/BuildXL-Installer](https://gh-pages.lumito.net/BuildXL-Installer/index.html)), then go to the downloads section and finally, download the latest version of BuildXL.

Please note that some versions may not be tested, so they may have bugs.
